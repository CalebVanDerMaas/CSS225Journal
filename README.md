# CSS225Journal
This is a journal assignment for my CSS255 class at SNHU. This module includes a business requirements and a system design requirements for a fictitious client company called DriverPass. 
•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
o	DriverPass is a web-based application designed to bring all the benefits of a brick and mortar driving instructor school to the tip of your fingers with a mobile or desktop device. DriverPass aims to provide the ability to purchase driving packages, as well as schedule drives, and examine driving history all in one application on your smartphone or computer device. DriverPass is made for a medium/large driving school with the goal of providing their available through the internet instead of solely in-person or though phone call. The system would be a self-contained web-application that would provide services through a web-browser. It would take advantage of 3rd party payment methods and provide offline support so that students could check their progress from anywhere.
•	What did you do particularly well?
o	The processes diagram was easy to put together. There are only so many things that this system is designed to do, so the documentation never got too complex or complicated. This makes it easy for other people to understand how the system should work, as well as what components may be necessary to produce this application in its final form. 
•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
o	I would improve the class diagram. I had a hard time seeing which parts of the application needed containerized and which could be made into components for modularization. It didn’t dawn on me until after I had turned in the assignment that most of the application could have been chunked into components for reusability. Most of these components would look the same from user to user, but the data displayed within would be unique to them. This way of thinking made it much easier to understand how I could have performed code splitting which would have made it easier when it was time to program the actual system.
•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
o	The client made it very clear what sort of data the user would need and how they would access the system. It is important to consider all the user’s needs because these are what make a great product. If there is ever a need of the user that is missing in the final product, the product will be frustrating to use and sometimes completely unusable. This means including failsafe in case the user cannot use the system at all, such as pointing them to a support line so they can get help in another way.
•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
o	I approach software as a growing tree. The design phase should create a great foundation so that components can grow from the strong code that has already been written. This follows the SOLID principles that are key to a successful software application.
